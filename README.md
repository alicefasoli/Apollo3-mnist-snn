# Spiking-Neural-Networks
Internship and thesis repo

I have take the code writed in python at
> https://github.com/markstrefford/Spiking-Neural-Network/blob/master/SNN_0.ipynb
<p> and I translated in C. 

In order to create an executable file is necessary to compile the code using the command: <br>
```gcc list.c neuron.c main.c -o snn0```
<p>then you can execute it.
